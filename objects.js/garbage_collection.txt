/*

It is an important concept in JavaScript to manage memory efficiently.

What does it do? It automatically deallocates memory, so we don't have to manage memory
                 as we do in other languages.
How does it work? The main goal of garbage collection is to identify
                  memory that is no longer reachable or needed and free it up for future use.

                  It handles this automatically using various algorithms.
